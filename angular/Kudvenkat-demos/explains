MODULES
---------
Modules are Angular equivalents of the Main() methods in .NET Console app for example
Modules can depend on other modules

To create a module we use angular object's module() method.
Second parameter is for module dependencies and since we don't have one here, we pass empty array as value for the second parameter.

let myApp = angular.module("myModule", []);

CONTROLLERS
-------------
Controllers are JavaScript construction function which main job is to create a model for the view.
We create anonymous function and attached it to a variable.
$scope is passed from AngularJS framework

my controller = function($scope){

/* Here we attach property to the $scope object and be available in the view */
    $scope.message = "My AngularJS Tutorial";
}
